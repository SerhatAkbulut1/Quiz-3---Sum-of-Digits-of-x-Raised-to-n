# Sum of Digits of x Raised to n

This program calculates the sum of the digits of x raised to the power of n until there is only a single digit remaining. The program takes two command-line arguments, x and n, and provides the sum of the digits as the output.

## Problem Description

Given a number x and its exponent n, the program calculates the value of x raised to the power of n, and then finds the sum of its digits. This process continues until the resulting number is reduced to a single digit. The program displays each step of the calculation and the final sum of digits.
